# Project 5: Retail Sales Insights with SQL + Python

This project is a complete data analysis pipeline that demonstrates the integration of a SQL database with Python for data visualization and business insights. The goal was to build a retail sales database from scratch, query it to find key metrics, and then present those findings in a formal report.

## 🚀 Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to understand how databases and data science work together to extract useful business insights. This project involves designing a small Retail Sales Database, writing SQL queries to find insights, and then visualizing the results using Python.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Database: MySQL
* Database Management: MySQL Workbench
* Analysis & Visualization: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Repository Contents

This folder contains the three final deliverables for the project:

1. `project.sql`: The complete SQL script. This file creates the `retail_db` schema, builds the `Products`, `Customers`, and `Sales` tables, inserts all sample data, and runs the final analysis queries.
2. `analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook used to connect to the database, run the SQL queries, and generate all visualizations and observations using Python.
3. `Report.pdf`: The final formal report summarizing the project's objective, database design, key findings, and business recommendations.

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings

The analysis of the sales data revealed several key insights:

* Revenue is Dominated by Electronics: The 'Electronics' category is the highest-performing by a significant margin.
* High-Value Customers Identified: A few key customers (like 'Frank Green' and 'Alice Smith') drive a large portion of the revenue through high-value purchases.
* Sales Are Inconsistent: Daily revenue is volatile and heavily dependent on large, infrequent sales rather than a steady stream of small purchases.
